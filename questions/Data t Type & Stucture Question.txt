1. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python. Provide examples of each.
2. Describe how Python handles type conversion between int, float, and str.
3. Compare and contrast a list and a tuple in Python. When would you prefer to use one over the other?
4. How does Pythonâ€™s set data structure ensure uniqueness of elements? What operations can be performed on a set?
5. Discuss how boolean values (True and False) are used in conditional statements and loops.
6. What are some common operations that can be performed on strings in Python? Provide examples.
7. Explain the concept of dictionary keys in Python. Why must they be immutable?

Practicle
9. Write a Python script to convert a list of strings into a dictionary, where each string is a key and the length of the string is the corresponding value.
10. Given a list of integers, write a program to remove all duplicate values using a set and return the list in sorted order.
11. Create a program that initializes an empty dictionary and then populates it by prompting the user to enter a key-value pair five times.
12. Write a Python script that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and age, and converts it into a dictionary with the name as the key and the age as the value.
13. Merge two dictionaries with the second dictionary overwriting duplicate keys
14. How can you convert a list to a tuple and vice versa in Python?
15. Explain the concept of slicing in Python. How does it work with lists and strings?
16. Peform a list, Tuple, Dictinory and Set using a Example.
